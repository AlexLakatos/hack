# Render Hack

## 30th March 6pm â€“ 10pm
{: .sub-heading}

Weâ€™re crazy proud to be running a super-mini hyper-great hack evening at [Render Conference](http://render-conf.com/).

## The Plan

* 6.00pm - Welcome ðŸ‘‹
* 6.15pm - Start Hacking
* 9.45pm - Stop Hacking
* 9.46pm - Presentations

## The Hacks

You're free to hack on anything you want as long as:

1. You can build it in 3.5 hours
2. It adheres to the [code of conduct](http://2017.render-conf.com/code-of-conduct) (ie. it's cool)

## Hack Guides

You can work on whatever you want. Though if you're stuck for ideas, or want help trying something new, you might be able to team up with a super-wonderful **Hack Guide**.

A **Hack Guide** will provide you with everything you need to get started with a project, and they'll also be on hand to give you help/tips along the way.  (Also, they're doing this because they're awesome - so be sure to throw some high-fives their way.)

## Will there be prizes?

Thereâ€™ll probably definitely be prizes.


## Who's organising this?

This event-within-an-event is being organised by [JSOxford](http://jsoxford.com). We're a local tech group, and also a synergetic business-cat powerhouse that lives to re-brand both "bad planning" and "late notice" as "âœ¨fun excitementâœ¨".

In particular: [Marcus](https://twitter.com/Marcus_Noble_), [Max](https://twitter.com/omgmog) & [Ben](https://twitter.com/benjaminbenben) have been instrumental in planning this event.
