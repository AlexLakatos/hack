Weâ€™re super excited to be running a super-mini hyper-great hack evening at [Render Conference](http://render-conf.com/) for the second year running.

[See what people built last year](/2017/hacks)

## The Plan

* 6.00pm - Welcome ðŸ‘‹
* 6.15pm - Start Hacking
* 8.55pm - Stop Hacking
* 9.00pm - Presentations


## The Hacks

You're free to hack on anything you want as long as:

1. You can build it in 3 hours
2. It adheres to the [code of conduct](http://2018.render-conf.com/code-of-conduct)


## Hack Guides

You can work on whatever you want. Though if you're stuck for ideas, or want help trying something new, you might be able to team up with one of our super-wonderful **Hack Guides**.

A **Hack Guide** will help you get started with a project, and they'll also be on hand to give you help/tips along the way and "[rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)" any problems you face. (Also, they're doing this because they're awesome - so be sure to throw some high-fives their way.)

<small>(psst, **you** can be a hack guide too - just give us a shout)</small>


## Where do I sign up?

There's no need to sign up, it's free to just come along and start working on something.

If you do want to register your idea ahead of time and see if other people want to work with you then you can register on GitHub!

We'd like people who do build something to register so we can share everything that we've achieved. But if you don't want to that's cool too!

## Will there be prizes?

Thereâ€™ll probably definitely maybe be prizes.

We're not looking for people to be competitive. Prizes will be awarded to people based on having fun and embracing the spirit of learning / hacking.

## Who's organising this?

This event-within-an-event is being organised by [JSOxford](http://jsoxford.com). We're a local tech group with a love of all things JavaScript-y and web-y, and also a synergetic business-cat powerhouse that lives to re-brand both "bad planning" and "late notice" as "âœ¨fun excitementâœ¨".

In particular: [Marcus](https://twitter.com/Marcus_Noble_), [Dan](https://twitter.com/DanielThePope) & [Rich](https://twitter.com/richdevans) have been instrumental in planning this event.
