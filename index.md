# JSOxHack Render

## 30th March 6pm – 10pm

We’re crazy proud to be running a super-mini hyper-great hack evening at Render Conf this year.

The hack will take place on the 30th of March (after the first day of the conference), and will be running from 6pm to 10pm.

To keep things simple - we’re going to be accepting a single URL per entry. These will be shown on screen while we do a quick-fire presentations after hacking.

We’ll also be having a number of “Hack Leaders” on hand to help people get up and running quickly on a few structured projects.
