Interested in chatbots? I'll bring along my "[echo-bot](https://github.com/AverageMarcus/echo-bot)" with example in various chat platforms (e.g. Slack, Telegram and Twitter)

Rather learn about some of the new and amazing features of JavaScript? Proxies? Decorators? I can help!

Or if you want to give TypeScript a try I can help with that too.
