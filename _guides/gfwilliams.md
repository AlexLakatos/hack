I'll bring along some Espruino/Puck.js powered hardware, so you can make some hardware stuff with JavaScript:

* 2 sets of Puck.js-powered Bluetooth Multicolour LED strings (thanks Ben!)
* A Puck.js-powered Bluetooth-controlled Party Popper (puck_popper.js/html)
* Espruino WiFi powered 16 x 16 grid of RGB LED lights (wifi_led_matrix.js)
* Espruino Pico powered 32 x 16 LED display and a big button (pico_led_button.js)
