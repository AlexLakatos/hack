Interested in applying functional programming techniques
to your JavaScript? Let's get down with semi-groups, monoids,
functors, and more&mdash;_oh my!_&mdash;using modern JavaScript.

We can also collab on REST-ful APIs and libraries, using
`npm` for great good, build tools like
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Babel](https://babeljs.io/),
and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

Also, *YOU* may be able to help me join the _official_
JavaScript Adventure Club. Ask me on the night about the
JavaScript Adventure Club&hellip;it's secrets and _sweet stickers_
will be ours!
