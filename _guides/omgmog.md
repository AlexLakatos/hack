**Multi-user VR experiences with A-Frame**

I'm going to bring along some Cardboard V1's (and maybe some fancier Cardboard headsets if I have the space!). 

We'll use A-Frame to easily create some VR things with HTML/JavaScript.

The only prior VR knowledge you need _really_ is how to type on a keyboard.
