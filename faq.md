## Do I need a laptop?

Probably. Though you could also find someone else with a laptop and make a team with them, or work on something that doesn't need a computer.

## Do I have to be coming to the Conference to attend this hack?

Yes.

## Are there any challenges?

Our main focus is for everyone to have a good time and try to learn something new. That being said, we may have some challenges on the day that people can attempt.
