## Do I need a laptop?

Probably.  Though you could also find someone else with a laptop and make a team with them, or work on something that doesn't need a computer.

## Do I have to be coming to the Conference to attend this hack?

Yes.

We run more hacks like this through the summer - [stay in touch](http://jsoxford.com) to hear about them.

## Why is there a limit to the number of people led by a hack guide?

1. To make it easier for them
2. To make sure we're building different things
